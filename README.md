# D-weather
This application demonstrates the use of an API and making the use of the API to fetch and show the response on the browser window.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of API and for that cause, this application is completely based on Javascript and asynchronous javascript in particular.

We've basically used the 'Async' which returns a promise and 'Await' which holds the reponse for the promise until the request is completely reolved along with 'fetch()' which helps in making the requests to an endpoint.

So, for the endpoint part, we've used the free API of AccuWeather (https://developer.accuweather.com) which helps us to find the location and the weather details of that location.
As we all know that with a free API having a Key to it, there comes certain limitations. 
In our case, with the free API, we can only make 15 requests per day with a particular API. 
So just know when you're not able to fetch any data, just delete the previous API and generate a new one and paste the key for the API into the forecast.js file.

It's that simple.
I hope you like the project and appreciate the efforts that were put into it.
